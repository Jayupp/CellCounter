# CellCounter

Bayside Biosciences Inc. cell counter project
-
Description:
-
A project used opencv to help biology scientists to track the cell numbers in order to analysis how the drug effect the cells. There are two type of the cells, one of the cell had the regular and smooth cell wall so this one without deal noice after thresholding processes and anothe one had irregular cell morphology so it needed to deal with the noise. This project saved biology scientists a lot of time to count the cell numbers and made converience for them because the camera was took pictures automation and it was avoid people forgot to check the time points.

Tools and Knowledge:
-
Opencv C++ library</br>
QT C++ platform</br>

Project Processes:
-
1. Built and developed the image analysis parts.</br>
2. GUI design and set up the componments to support the user experiences.</br>
3. Assemblied the code and the UI design to make as unit.</br>
4. Tested the software and analysis the error.</br>
